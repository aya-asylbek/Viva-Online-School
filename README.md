## About the Project

Viva Online School is designed as a complete learning management system (LMS) that enables:

- **üë©‚Äçüè´ Teachers** to create, edit, and manage courses, assign grades, and monitor student progress
- **üéì Students** to enroll in courses, view grades, and track GPA in real-time
- **üß± Built** following OOP principles for scalability and clean architecture

## Technology Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Frontend | React (Vite), JavaScript, Context API, CSS |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Authentication | JWT (JSON Web Token) |
| Testing | Vitest |
| Development Tooling | Concurrently |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub |

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure JWT-based login and registration
- Role-based access for students and teachers
- Centralized AuthContext for managing global user state

### User Management
- CRUD operations for users (create, read, update, delete)
- Search users by ID, name, or email
- User details pages with course history and grades
- Role-based dashboards (Student / Teacher)

### Course Management
- Add, edit, and delete courses
- Set prerequisites and enrollment limits
- Display available seats dynamically
- Inline editing for quick course updates

### Prerequisites System
- Define course prerequisites
- Visual indicators for required courses
- Automatic prerequisite checking before enrollment

### Enrollment Management
- Enroll and unenroll students
- Capacity management and seat tracking
- Check prerequisites before allowing enrollment

### Grades & GPA
- Assign grades (A+ to F scale)
- Auto-calculated GPA
- Color-coded grade visualization
- Track assignment dates for each grade
- Student grade history

### Additional Highlights
- Middleware-based route protection
- Organized folder structure with MVC pattern
- Modular React components for each feature
- Responsive design for all devices

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Users
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(20) CHECK (role IN ('student', 'teacher'))
);

-- Courses
CREATE TABLE courses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  credits INTEGER,
  enrollment_limit INTEGER DEFAULT 30
);

-- Prerequisites
CREATE TABLE prerequisites (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  course_id INTEGER REFERENCES courses(id),
  prerequisite_id INTEGER REFERENCES courses(id)
);

-- Enrollments
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  course_id INTEGER REFERENCES courses(id),
  enrolled_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Grades
CREATE TABLE grades (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  course_id INTEGER REFERENCES courses(id),
  grade VARCHAR(2),
  date_assigned TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
